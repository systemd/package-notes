by various tools. There is no machine-readable metadata about dependencies
loaded at build time via

available by default. The ELF Dlopen Metadata specification aims to fill this
gap by defining a common format. See https://systemd.io/ELF_DLOPEN_METADATA/.

This tool allows parsing such a note, and printing out the result in various
